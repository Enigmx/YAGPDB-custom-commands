This is the interface for custom commands. In the first red box, you will configure how is the command executed (after a message is sent? after a reaction is added? after a button is used?), in the second red box you will configure what are the keywords of the trigger. In the last box, you will paste the code of the custom commands you will find here, depending of how each is instructed to be configured.
